## Security
1. This is an open-source repo that you can trust and verify. We use go mod instead of go vendor to prevent anyone inserts back door in vendor files.
2. This project sticks to use go native library. The only 3rd parity library is [go-bip39](https://github.com/tyler-smith/go-bip39), But we use go mod to make sure we use the same version as [Ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/releases/tag/v1.9.12)(which already verify by thousands of developers).
3. The only weak point of this tool is using a weak message to generate mnemonics. Please don't use birthday, phone number, or anything easy to guess.
